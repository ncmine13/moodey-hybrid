# App

> This project is an expansion and revamp of a project constructed for coursework in April 2017. This hybrid app uses the Quasar front-end framework, which runs on Vue.js and node, and a backend built with an Express server and a Sequelize ORM with SQlite.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
$ quasar dev

# build for production with minification
$ quasar build

# lint code
$ quasar lint
```
